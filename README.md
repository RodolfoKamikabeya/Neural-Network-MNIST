# Neural-Network-MNIST

The purpose of this project is to introduce the concept of Neural Network and Machine learning. Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. 

This process consists in built a supervised learning task to classify the hand-written digits of the MNIST dataset. The focus is to take a larger number of handwritten digits and train the machine to automatically infer rules for recognizing the digits. Furthermore, by increasing the number of neurons, the network can learn more about handwriting and improve its accuracy.
