# Neural-Network-MNIST

## About The Project
The purpose of this project is to introduce the concept of Neural Network and Machine learning. Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. 

This process consists in built a supervised learning task to classify the hand-written digits of the MNIST dataset. The focus is to take a larger number of handwritten digits and train the machine to automatically infer rules for recognizing the digits. Furthermore, by increasing the number of neurons, the network can learn more about handwriting and improve its accuracy. 

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Anaconda] (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* [Pytorch] (https://pytorch.org/)

## Getting Started

Build the Environment

1.	Download and install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2.	Go to the “Quick Start Locally” section on Pytorch’s site 
3.	Select your preferences according to your OS
4.	Open the terminal and run the install command (it is recommended to install the latest Python version).
5.	Once you finish the Anaconda installation it automatically creates the Jupyter Notebook interactive environment in your local machine.
6.	To open the Jupyter Notebook, please open the terminal and use the command "jupyter notebook"
7.	To organize the various parts of the lab, we will create a folder in your notebook. On your browser, select “New” located in your right corner and click in Folder
8.	An Untitled Folder will be created to your tree, select the folder and click in Rename located in your left corner. Please rename the folder as Pytorch_Lab
9.	Open the folder, select “New” located in your right corner and click in “Python 3” to create a new project and renamed it as MNIST_NN.
10.	Once opened, you will be able to insert and run our Neural Network code.

## Code
The code can be break in the following parts:
* Create the Neural Network
* Importing MNIST dataset -> The MNIST dataset consists of greyscale handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels.
* Training our NN ->The neural network learns by iterating multiple times over the available data. The terms learn refers to the adjustment of weights of the network to minimize the loss.
* Testing the Neural Network -> The number set for testing the network can be found in the website http://lettersandnumbers.org/printable-handwriting-numbers-1-to-50.html
